I found this assignment easy to get through. Granted, I did have a little trouble getting everything configured, but once I did, everything was smooth sailing from there. I¡¯m not exactly adept with computers, so I had more trouble than I¡¯d like to admit with this assignment. Personally, I couldn¡¯t for the life of me figure out how to change the README file for the life of me, lol
Although I had trouble with this assignment, I did not seek any external resources to help me. Instead, I brute forced the steps I couldn¡¯t figure out until something worked. This is probably because I am quite prideful and didn¡¯t want to admit I struggled with the easiest assignment. Next time, I will be sure to seek help through the discord.
